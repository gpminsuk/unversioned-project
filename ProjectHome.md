3D Game Engine Exodus3D!

Anyone who are interested in developing game engine, shoot me an email so that I can add you as a developer!

I am hoping that Exodus could work on any platform (Windows, Mac, Mobile) with any 3D libraries (DX, OpenGL and so on). To accomplish that we need to have high abstraction of code, and for that, we need people's efforts.

Thanks.
